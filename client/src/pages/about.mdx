## Hosting

As a serverless application, Hirameku is designed for hosting in a major public cloud. AWS is supported initially, with Azure and　Google Cloud slated for subsequent releases. While the application is designed to take advantage of the cloud providers' various PaaS offerings, portability limits these options to services with some degree of parity. These include the following:

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/blobs/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
- [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/), [Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cdn/), [Google Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/functions/), [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/)
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/api-management/), [Google Cloud API Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway)
- [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/service-bus/), [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)
- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), [Azure Communication Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/communication-services/), [SendGrid on Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/sendgrid-app/sendgrid-email)
- [AWS ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cache/), [Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/)
- [AWS DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cosmos-db/), [Mongo Atlas on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/mongodb)
- [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/monitor/), [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/)

In addition to PaaS hosting, Hirameku is also designed for deployment to Docker, and local development uses Docker Desktop. This　includes a number of containerized technologies to stand-in for public cloud capabilities, such as:

- [nginx](https://nginx.org/)
- [Seq](https://datalust.co/)
- [smtp4dev](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
